<li>Bike riding uses minimal fossil fuels and is a pollution-free mode of transport.</li> <li>Bikes reduce the need to build, service and dispose of cars.</li>

<li>Cycling 10 km each way to work would save 1500 kg of greenhouse gas emissions each year. </li><li>Also, as traffic delays and interruptions to traffic flow in
Australia's six major cities account <br>for around 13 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year, cycling during peak hours would contribute to <br>
further emission reductions by reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.

        <ul><li>Transport (15.5%) is second only to food (18.2%) as the largest item of household expenditure in Australia.</li> <li>The family car costs up to 55 cents per kilometre to run. </li><li>In comparison, the cost of buying and maintaining a bike is around one per cent of the cost of buying and maintaining a car.</li>

       <li> The family car costs on average 79 cents per kilometre to operate1. </li><li>comparison, the cost of buying and maintaining a bike is much cheaper, and even if you already own a car, a bicycle is more cost effective than driving if you ride at least 20 kilometres a week2.
        
       </li> <li> out of 10 Queenslanders own a bike and more than half of all Queenslanders have a bike in working order in their household.</li>
        
       <li> Using a bike for shorter trips may allow you to avoid buying a second car, which will save families thousands of dollars each year. </li><li> RACQ estimates that the cost of buying a new car every five years with an average mileage of 15 000 km per year varies from A$84.63 to A$194.90 per week.</li>
        
      <li>  Cycling 10 km each way to work each day will save about A$1700 per year in transport costs (including all running costs and depreciation).</li><li> Also, bicycle parking is usually free, easily accessible and more convenient than car parking.
